# obsidianProject
Are there many files in Obsidian that you don't have time to read? This project is trying to solve this problem. 
Functional:
1. The service scans your directory with md(Obsidian) files with some frequency
2. Converts them to pdf
3. Stores everything in Postgres
4. Periodically sends the finished pdf file to telegram or email
